 * 2. Updating each pixel to a new color based on the ColorPicker
 *

 * after every `frameInterval` pixels are filled.  To ensure a smooth Animation, the first
 * frame is always the starting image and the final frame is always the finished image.

 * (For example, if `frameInterval` is `4` the frames are:
 *   - The initial frame
 *   - Then after the 4th pixel has been filled
 *   - Then after the 8th pixel has been filled
 *   - ...
 *   - The final frame, after all pixels have been filed)
